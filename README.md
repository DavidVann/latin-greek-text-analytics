# latin-greek-text-analytics

This is the repository for code related to my DS 5001 Exploratory Text Analytics final project.

## Data source

- Data downloaded from [Perseus Digital Library](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/opensource/download) at Tufts University (Greek and Roman collection texts).
- [Direct download to compressed archive](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/opensource/downloads/texts/hopper-texts-GreekRoman.tar.gz)

## Box folder

- [Box folder](https://virginia.box.com/s/tvv3pntcbtveehwmzxonjdzvfoyobhsm)
- Includes complete data file (from Perseus) and reduced subset used for project.

## Description

- Initial collection contains works from authors across the Classical period (Greek and Roman). Most have English translations, but some are only available in the original language.
- Subset used for project consists of selected works (translated to English) by the authors Aeschylus, Euripides, Hesiod, Homer, anonymous (Homeric Hymns), Ovid, Sophocles, and Vergil. Some works/authors I would have liked to include were not available for full-text downloading (several plays by Euripides or Pindar's Odes, for example), and I wasn't interested in taking the effort to scrape these manually.
- Further analyses could look at more historical or rhetorical/philosophical works like those from Aristotle, Julius Caesar, Herodotus, etc.
